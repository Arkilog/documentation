# Documentation

###Anatomy of a Jason view
**[Learn the basic structure of a JASON view](../document)**<br>
Just like HTML has basic tags such as body, div, span, li, etc, Jasonette has JSON based tags to describe the structure of a view.
---
###Components
**[Learn component syntax](components.md)**<br>
Components are the most basic units of user interface, such as image, label, textarea, button, slider, etc. 
---
###Layout
**[Learn layouts](layout.md)**<br>
In many cases we combine multiple components to contstruct a unit. We use layouts to do this.
---
###Link multiple views
**[Learn linking](href.md)**<br>
Above three sections are all you need to know to display content in a view. But what if we want multiple views? We can link them using `href`.
---
###Actions
**[Learn actions](actions.md)**<br>
Actions define a task or a sequence of tasks you wish to run, such as network request, audio play, camera access, geolocation, dispalying banners, etc.
---
###Templates
**[Learn templates](templates.md)**<br>
You can use templates to dynamically render data, such as remote network content, local data, and user input.
