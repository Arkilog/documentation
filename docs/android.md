Jasonette comes with a default demo JSON url embedded. Let's try running it to make sure it works.

##Step 5. CONNECT THE PHONE AND RUN

It will show up a dialog that looks like this.

Here you can either choose to run it on an emulator or a real device.

**To learn how to connect the phone, or how to run it on an emulator, [read this](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app.html).**

##Step 6. CUSTOMIZE!

Now let's try changing the JSON url so you can turn it into your own app.

First, click the "Project" tab on the left side.

Then find `app` > `java` > `com.jasonette.seed` > `JasonSettings`.

Update the return value for the url to your own JSON url. That's it!

If you don't have a JSON yet, [here are some example apps you can try quickly](/examples)
