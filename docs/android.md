##Step 5. CONNECT THE PHONE AND RUN

It will show up a dialog that looks like this.

Here you can either choose to run it on an emulator or a real device.

**To learn how to connect the phone, or how to run it on an emulator, [read this](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app.html).**

##Step 6. CUSTOMIZE!

Now let's try changing the JSON url so you can turn it into your own app.

First, click the "Project" tab on the left side.

Then find `app` > `java` > `com.jasonette.seed` > `JasonSettings`.

Update the return value for the url to your own JSON url. That's it!

If you don't have a JSON yet, [here are some example apps you can try quickly](/examples)

# Documentation

###Anatomy of a Jason view
**[Learn the basic structure of a JASON view](document.md)**<br>
Just like HTML has basic tags such as body, div, span, li, etc, Jasonette has JSON based tags to describe the structure of a view.
---
###Components
**[Learn component syntax](components.md)**<br>
Components are the most basic units of user interface, such as image, label, textarea, button, slider, etc. 
---
###Layout
**[Learn layouts](layout.md)**<br>
In many cases we combine multiple components to construct a unit. We use layouts to do this.
---
###Link multiple views
**[Learn linking](href.md)**<br>
Above three sections are all you need to know to display content in a view. But what if we want multiple views? We can link them using `href`.
---
###Actions
**[Learn actions](actions.md)**<br>
Actions define a task or a sequence of tasks you wish to run, such as network request, audio play, camera access, geolocation, displaying banners, etc.
---
###Templates
**[Learn templates](templates.md)**<br>
You can use templates to dynamically render data, such as remote network content, local data, and user input.
