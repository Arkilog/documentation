# JASON

JASON (JSON As System Operating Notation) is a JSON markup for representing, transmitting, and receiving applications over the network.

Normally [JSON](http://www.json.org) is used to store and send only data. But JASON uses JSON to store application logic, allowing for instant portability of applications.

## Usage

[Jasonette](http://www.jasonette.com/beta) is an iOS implementation of JASON.
