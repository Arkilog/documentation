# JASONETTE DOCUMENTATION

###[View the generated documentation >](https://jasonette.github.io/documentation)



This repository serves two purposes:

**1. Source repository for the documentation of [Jasonette](https://www.jasonette.com) APIs** - We use [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org) and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) to auto-generate a clean documentation website from the markdown files in this repository. You can view the generated documentation at [https://jasonette.github.io/documentation](https://jasonette.github.io/documentation)

**2. Discussing JASON specification** - [The issues section](https://github.com/Jasonette/documentation/issues) is used for discussing and deciding on the specification of JASON markup. The goal is to keep the syntax clean, consistent and efficient by hearing ideas from as many people as possible.
